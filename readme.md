## Description

The aim of this project is to develop a complete and formal calculation engine in Python to help do mathematics.

In fact, more precisely, the goal was mainly to test a method of implementing a formal calculation engine, to see if the idea I had worked, and how far one can go with the structure chosen for the implementation without it causing a major obstacle.

The implementation I have chosen is based on object-oriented programming, and indeed, each mathematical 'object' will have its own class and a number of methods corresponding to it.

For the moment, the implemented objects are :

- `class Hypothese()`
- `class Objet()`
- `class Reel(Objet)`
- `class Variable(Objet)`
- `class Function(Objet)`
- `class Derivee(Function)`
- `class Oppose(Objet)`
- `class Somme(Objet)`
- `class Soustraction(Objet)`
- `class Produit(Objet)`
- `class Frac(Objet)`
- `class Ln(Function)`
- `class Puissance(Objet)`
- `class Polynome(Objet)`
- `class Matrice(Objet)`
- `class Ensemble()`
- `class EnsembleVide(Ensemble)`
- `class SousEnsemble(Ensemble)`
- `class EnsembleObjets(Ensemble)`
- `class UnionEnsembles(Ensemble)`
- `class IntersectionEnsembles(Ensemble)`
- `class DifferenceEnsembles(Ensemble)`

I have only begun to scratch the surface of the mathematical world in this computational engine, and there is still a lot of work to do, but it is still an interesting project that I hope to at least bring to a reasonable stage.
